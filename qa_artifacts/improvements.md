# Suggested Improvements

1. Standardize all error messages with action hints.
2. Add callback data versioning to prevent stale interactions.
3. Add strict context guards for DM/group/channel misuse.
4. Add adaptive retry/jitter for rate-limited endpoints.
5. Ensure admin flows have explicit unauthorized responses.
6. Add snapshot-based UI text consistency checks.
7. Add structured telemetry for onboarding drop-off diagnostics.
